  <p>Welcome to the Report It! patch prgram for Juniors and Cadettes, or anyone who wants to learn more about journalism. As Girl Scouts we have a job to make the world a better place, and one way we can do that is by educating ourselves. In this guide you will find fun activities that you can do to learn more about journalism, and at the end you can order a fun patch! </p>
